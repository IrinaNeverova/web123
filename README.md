Welcome to my test web project. 

Here I have worked on :
- dark theme (vanilla is + css)
- email validation (regular expressions usega, but have to dig it a little more)

On the next updates  I'm planning to add this features:
- dark theme should depend on day time
- add nice looking counter connected with the local time
- work around responsive design
- try grid layout
